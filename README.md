🎨 Using the Figma Design File
This repository includes a .fig file that contains design components created in Figma. Follow the steps below to download and open it:

📥 How to Download the .fig File
Navigate to the design folder (or wherever the .fig file is located).
Click on the .fig file (e.g., dashboard-layout.fig).
Click the “Download” button or “Raw” → Right-click → Save As to save the file to your computer.

📂 How to Open the .fig File in Figma
Go to Figma.com and log in.
On your dashboard, click the Import button (or drag the file into the browser).
Select the downloaded .fig file.
Figma will open the file in a new tab, where you can view or edit the design.

🛠 Notes
.fig files are Figma’s native format and can only be opened in Figma.
If you want to collaborate, consider uploading the file to a shared Figma workspace.
GitHub does not preview .fig files, so downloading is required.
